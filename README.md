## 🚀 How It Works

Let me tell you how my program works! The process is straightforward and involves three main steps:

### 📋 Step-by-Step Workflow

**Step 1: Setup Cloud Archive** 🌐
- First, you need to set up Google Cloud credentials to enable cloud storage functionality
- This involves creating a Google Cloud project, enabling the Drive API, and downloading your `credentials.json` file
- Save the credentials in a dedicated folder for security
- Add the credentials paths in step 2

**Step 2: Create & Configure YAML File** ⚙️
- Download the example `config.yaml` file from the repository and edit it according to your preferences [download](config_example.yaml)
- Edit this configuration file to specify your download preferences, storage locations, and other settings
- This file acts as the control center for your archiving operations

**Step 3: Run the Program** 🏃‍♂️
- Finally, execute the program using the command-line interface with your desired parameters
- The program will use your cloud credentials and configuration to start downloading and organizing gazette files
- Sit back and watch as your gazettes are systematically archived!
